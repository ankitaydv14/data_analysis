# Hiring_Process_Analysis
Hiring Process Analysis was the project completed under the specialization training at Trainity platform in which I have applied the Advanced Excel skill to draw the useful insights from the data provided. I first used Exploratory Data Analysis to clean the dataset and then applied Advanced Excel skill (pivot tables, charts, graphs etc. ) and statistics to draw the insights about given Tasks- 
1) How many males and females were hired ?
2) What is the average salary offered in the company ?
3) Draw the class-interval for salary.
4) Draw pie chart/ graph chart to show the proportion of people in different departments.
5) Represent different post tiers on Chart/Graph.
